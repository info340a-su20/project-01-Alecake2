    <h1>Project Topic Proposal</h1>

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        Students will perfom better in their academics if they can find courses
        that matches their learning styles. However, they sometimes don't get enough 
        accurate information about their classes before they design their schedules.
        One of the most common way for getting information about a course and
        instructor is through <cite><a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/">
        RateMyProfessor.com</a></cite>. Which is kind of bias sometimes, and teachers 
        don't get the chance to introduce themselves. Also, the rating score can be 
        skewed by extreme scores when the number of students who rate one instructor 
        is small. For more information on the disadvantage of this website, please 
        read article <cite><a href="https://www.statepress.com/article/2018/08/sp-opinion-students-
        should-not-soley-rely-on-rate-my-professors">Opinion: Students should not solely rely on 
        Rate My Professors to pick classes</a></cite>.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>The website I have a in my mind contains a new system that allows UW students 
        to get better insights about the class they are interested taking. When one 
        professor sets up a profile for one of his courses, he/she get to write an
        introduction on his teaching style. Then when students rate and comment 
        the professor, they will give a rate base on how accurate is this professor's 
        description is rather than on how good is this instuctor. In addition, 
        each student can put the average number of hours they spend on this class. 
        On the other hand, the instuctors can put more information on their page such 
        as sample lecture video, average grade, average reading load and average number 
        of practice problems.</p>

        <p>By collecting and presenting more factual data like data from previous 
        quarters rather than students' opinions, UW students can gather more accurate 
        information on whether the style of one course fits their learning habits when 
        they search the course, and combine the description of the instructors and 
        students' rating can make the result less biased. Also, being able to watch 
        a sample lecture can be very helpful on assessing whether this class fits 
        students' learning style.</p>
